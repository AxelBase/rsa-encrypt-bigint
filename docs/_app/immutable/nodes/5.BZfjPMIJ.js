The security of the entire system depends on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. The process begins by selecting two distinct large primes, commonly called p and q. These primes should be roughly the same size and chosen randomly to avoid predictability.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Once p and q are selected, the modulus n is calculated by multiplying them together. This n becomes part of both the public and private keys and is the number that must remain hard to factor. Next, Euler's totient function is computed using the formula phi equals p minus one times q minus one. This value represents the count of integers up to n that are coprime with it.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">A small public exponent e is then chosen, most commonly sixty-five thousand five hundred thirty-seven. This number must be coprime with phi, meaning their greatest common divisor is one. Finally, the private exponent d is found such that d times e equals one modulo phi. This modular inverse ensures that encryption followed by decryption returns the original message.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Importance of Prime Quality</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The strength of RSA rests entirely on the size and randomness of the primes. Small or poorly chosen primes make factoring feasible. Modern standards recommend at least one thousand twenty-four bits total, with two thousand forty-eight bits preferred for long-term security.</p> <h3>Common Choices in Practice</h3> <ul class="svelte-1apmzc4"><li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Public exponent of sixty-five thousand five hundred thirty-seven for efficiency</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Balanced prime sizes to avoid attacks that exploit imbalance</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Strong randomness to prevent predictable key generation</li></ul> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">In this browser-based demo, you can experiment with different key sizes and observe how the resulting numbers grow exponentially while still allowing fast encryption thanks to clever mathematical shortcuts.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why is the public exponent usually small?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">A small e makes encryption faster, while the private exponent d handles the heavier computation during decryption.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">What happens if primes are too close together?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">It becomes easier to factor n using difference-of-squares techniques, weakening security.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Can the same primes be reused?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">No, reusing primes across different keys compromises all related keys if one is factored.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1apmzc4">Next, explore how these keys are actually used to transform messages into secure ciphertext.</p></article></div>`);function q(m){var e=x();b("1apmzc4",d=>{var a=w(),u=f(y(a),6);t(4),i(()=>l(u,"content",`${p??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),v(()=>{g.title="How RSA Key Generation Works with Large Primes | RSA BigInt Demo Blog"}),r(d,a)});var s=o(e),h=o(s);t(4),n(s),t(2),n(e),i(()=>l(h,"href",`${p??""}/blog`)),r(m,e)}export{q as component,T as universal};
