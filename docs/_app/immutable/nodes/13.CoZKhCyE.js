Introduction</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">Welcome to the <strong>Simple RSA Encrypt with BigInt</strong> web utility, a purely educational, client-side demonstration tool for RSA encryption using JavaScript BigInt. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding any information related to your use of the tool. Because the application runs <strong>entirely in your browser</strong> and is <strong>stateless with no backend</strong>, <strong>we collect, store, transmit, or process zero personal data or user content</strong>. This policy is provided for transparency and to affirm our commitment to maximum privacy.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">We do not collect any information from you, including:</p> <ul class="svelte-7ke6fz"><li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Personal Identifiable Information</strong> — names, email addresses, IP addresses, or any identifiers</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Usage or Technical Data</strong> — browser type, device details, operating system, or timestamps</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Input Content</strong> — plaintext messages, generated keys, ciphertexts, or any numbers you enter or produce</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Analytics or Tracking Data</strong> — no cookies, pixels, beacons, or third-party analytics scripts are used</li></ul> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">All operations — key generation, encryption, and display — occur <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>. Nothing is ever sent to us or any third party.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">3. How the Tool Operates</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">When you use this utility:</p> <ul class="svelte-7ke6fz"><li class="svelte-7ke6fz">All RSA mathematics and BigInt computations happen locally via JavaScript</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz">No server requests are made at any point</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz">Browser temporary memory may hold your inputs during the session, but this is cleared on page refresh or close</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz">Any copy-to-clipboard or manual saving of keys/ciphertext is handled by your browser only</li></ul> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">This design guarantees <strong>complete data isolation</strong> and makes the tool suitable for educational experimentation without privacy concerns.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">4. Third-Party Services and CDNs</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">The site uses Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons via public CDNs for styling. These CDNs may log standard HTTP request metadata (e.g., IP address) when fetching resources, but we have <strong>no control over or access to</strong> that data. No tracking scripts or analytics are embedded.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">We <strong>do not use cookies</strong>, localStorage, sessionStorage, or any persistent client-side storage for tracking purposes. The application remains fully stateless.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">6. Security Disclaimer</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">While we collect no data, <strong>this is not a production cryptographic tool</strong>. It uses weak randomness (Math.random) and textbook RSA without padding. We recommend using secure, audited libraries for any real encryption needs. Security of your device and browser is your responsibility.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">7. Children's Privacy</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">The tool is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">8. Changes to This Policy</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">We may revise this Privacy Policy occasionally. Updates will appear here with a new effective date. Continued use constitutes acceptance of changes.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-7ke6fz">This utility is built on a <strong>zero-data-collection</strong> model. Your privacy is protected by design — thank you for using it responsibly for educational purposes only.</p></article></div>`);function R(d){var e=w();k("7ke6fz",u=>{var o=b(),f=m(v(o),6);t(4),r(()=>l(f,"content",`${c??""}/privacy`)),h(()=>{g.title="Privacy Policy | Simple RSA Encrypt with BigInt"}),a(u,o)});var s=i(e),y=i(s);t(4),n(s),t(2),n(e),r(()=>l(y,"href",`${c??""}/`)),a(d,e)}export{R as component,x as universal};
